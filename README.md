## Project: NVIM configuration
+ First attempt to build very basic Neovim configuration files 

## Sources: 
+ kickstart_nvim
+ typecraft youtube channel --> neovim for newbs
+ LunarVim --> neovim from scratch

## TL;DR:
+ new at git && github commands, README, markdown language, etc...
+ working on all of that new material as well
+ this is first take on a whole lot
